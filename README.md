# TabWatch
An observing and caring chrome extension for your internet
<br>
Created by <a href = "http://ichauster.github.io/">Ivan Chau</a> and <a href = "http://brendonho.com">Brendon Ho</a>

The chrome extension provides informative statistics on your chrome usage from the tabs you visit. In addition, it allows the user to block certain sites, and informs them when they should take a break from the internet.

## Technologies
We mainly used the chrome.api, but also used chart.js and AM for some nice looking charts. The entire app was built using JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Wanna try?
Download the repository, go to <a href = "chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions</a>, and drag the entire directory into the window. We are still looking to make some changes before we upload the final product, let us know if there are any bugs/suggestions.

### Future
This app won top 12 at MHacks Nano, and we hope to release on the Chrome Web Store soon.
